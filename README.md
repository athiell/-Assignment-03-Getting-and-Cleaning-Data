# -Assignment-03-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

In this assignment, we reviewed major weather-related storm events based on state level data for the year we were born. In this instance, I reviewed data for year 1994. After data munipulation and cleaning of the column names, data held within, etc., the final plot produced shows the # of storm events in 1994 organized by the land area (in square miles). This was also color-coded by region to show trending by those associated categories.
